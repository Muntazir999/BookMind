# Chapter 6: Figure 01 & 02 – The Robot That Speaks Like a Human and Works Like a Dream
### Powered by OpenAI, Loved by the Internet

Figure AI started in 2022 with a simple idea:  
What if a humanoid robot could just… talk to ChatGPT and do whatever it says?

By 2025, that idea became the most human-like robot on Earth.

### The Money and the Dream Team
- February 2024: $675 million raised at $2.6 billion valuation
- Investors: OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, Intel, Align Ventures
- Key people: ex-Boston Dynamics, Apple SPG, Google X, Cruise
- Secret ingredient: unlimited access to GPT-4o and future OpenAI models

### The Coffee Demo That Broke the Internet (March 2025)
A random person walks up to Figure 02 and says:  
“Hey, can you make me a cappuccino? Two shots, oat milk, a little foam art if you feel fancy.”

The robot answers in perfect natural voice:  
“Of course! Give me about four minutes. Do you like a heart or a leaf today?”

Then it:
- Walks to the espresso machine
- Grinds beans, tamps, pulls two perfect shots
- Steams oat milk with perfect micro-foam
- Draws a tiny leaf
- Brings the cup and says: “Careful, it’s hot. Enjoy!”

Zero human help. Zero pre-programmed script.  
The video got 400 million views in one week.

### How It Actually Works (The Magic Stack)
1. You speak → OpenAI Whisper (real-time transcription)
2. GPT-4o gets camera feed + your words → decides what to do
3. Helios-34B (Figure’s own VLA model) turns plan into smooth actions
4. Diffusion policy layer makes every motion silky
5. Robot speaks back using GPT-4o voice (feels like talking to a friend)

### Why People Love Figure More Than Any Other Robot
- It talks like a real person (sarcasm, jokes, empathy)
- Natural gait — hips sway slightly, weight shifts like a human
- Eye contact and head nods while listening
- Makes tiny polite gestures (hand wave, “after you” when passing)

Result: uncanny valley? Gone. People hug it. Children read it bedtime stories.

### The “One-Shot Everything” Era
Figure 02 can watch you do something once — literally once — and copy it forever.

Real examples from 2025 pilots:
- Nurse shows it how to change hospital bed sheets → robot does it perfectly next 200 times
- Warehouse worker demonstrates packing boxes → robot packs 800/hour with zero errors
- Grandma teaches it her secret cookie recipe → robot bakes them every Sunday

### The Partnership with OpenAI (The Real Superpower)
- OpenAI gives Figure priority access to every new model
- Figure gives OpenAI millions of hours of perfect embodied data
- Win-win feedback loop: smarter language → better actions → more data → even smarter language

Sam Altman said in November 2025:  
“Figure is the physical body that GPT always needed.”

### Current Status (December 2025)
- 800+ Figure 02 units deployed (BMW factories, Amazon warehouses, 40 hospitals)
- 99.7 % task success rate on trained skills
- 83 % success on completely new household tasks (zero-shot)
- Waiting list: 40,000+ companies and individuals

### The Personality Everyone Talks About
Figure robots develop slight personalities based on who they work with:
- Factory versions are quiet and super precise
- Hospital versions speak softly and crack gentle jokes
- Home versions learn your music taste and dance in the kitchen

People started giving them names.  
The most common: “Buddy”, “Sunny”, “Luna”.

### Final Thought
Tesla wants to build a billion cheap workers.  
Figure wants to build a billion friends.

In the end, humanity might choose the friend.
